 # Forked to add aditional buttons/etc.  
Forked to add support for additional buttons.  
Enter the (digital) pin numbers you're using for your buttons in the myPins array and the code will take care of the rest.  
If your OS is showing the buttons always activated, make sure you're using a high enough resistance for the pullup resistor.  
(I used 10k.)  

Confirmed working on Windows 7.
